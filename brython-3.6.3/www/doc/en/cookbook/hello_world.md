Problem
-------

Make the browser display "Hello world !"


Solution
--------

```python
from browser import document
document <= "Hello world !"
```

`document` is a word defined in module **browser** that represents the 
document (the content of the web page). It supports the operation `<=` 
meaning "add content". Here the content is a simple Python string.
