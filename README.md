# BrythonIDE
An online Python editor and development environment

This is my take on writing a simple online editor to write [Brython](https://brython.info) programs. 

One of the main purposes served by this IDE is to enable writing short programs (i.e., "sketches" in Processing parlance) 
using the Javascript processing implementation called [p5](https://p5js.org). This is made
compatible with Brython by means of a python package called *p5py*, which is also provided. 

Some sample Brython/P5 sketches are also included.
